A text editor that maximizes simplicity and efficiency. Specifically, it shall follow these goals:

1. All functionality can be performed via the primary keys (those reachable from the home row). The mouse and non-primary keys may also perform functionality where it makes sense but they should never be needed.
2. All user input shall be modal. Keys may implement different functionality depending on the current mode of the application.
3. Paper shall utilize already implemented tools and commands wherever possible.
